This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages
from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import mpg
```

@fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.


```{python}
#| label: fig-scatterplot
#| fig-cap: City and highway mileage for 38 popular car models
#| fig-alt: Scatterplot of city vs highway mileage for cars. Points are colored by number of cylinders. The scatterplot displays a positve, linear, and strong relationship between city and highway mileage. Mileage increases as the number of cylinders decreases.
#| echo: true

    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)

    + theme_bw()
    + theme(figure_size=(6, 3.5))

```

There are `{python} len(mpg)` observations in our data.
